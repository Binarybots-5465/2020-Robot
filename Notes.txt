Notes for 2020

Goals:
 *Improve on Motion Magic
 *Work on some type of vision system


Notes for this year:
 *We will use pneumatics this year for climbing and for the control panel
 *Currently (1st week) we will be using two controllers (Game Cube and Generic Logitech)


Concepts that might be useful later in design:
 *We could use the ADXRS450 gyroscope mounted vertically to determine if we're level when climbing

Pneumatics notes:
 * Solenoid for the stopper (retracts to release the spring loaded lift) for the climber is normally activated (and motors will wind back [REVERSE] and compress the mechanism)
 * Solenoid for the balls will normally be activated (so the balls can't go through)  

 * When the elevator is compressed (and in the starting match state) after completely climbing the piston for the climber will extend (locking the plate and the mechanism) 
    and the motors will HALT (to prevent strain on the spring loaded mechanism and gears)
