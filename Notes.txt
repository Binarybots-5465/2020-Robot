Notes for 2020

Goals:
 *Improve on Motion Magic
 *Work on some type of vision system


Notes for this year:
 *We will use pneumatics this year for climbing and for the control panel
 *Currently (1st week) we will be using two controllers (Game Cube and Generic Logitech)


Concepts that might be useful later in design:
 *We could use the ADXRS450 gyroscope mounted vertically to determine if we're level when climbing

Pneumatics notes:
 * Solenoid for the stopper (slides out and hits plate) for the climber is normally deactivated
 * Solenoid for the balls will normally be activated (so the balls can't go through)
