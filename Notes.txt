Notes for 2020

Goals:
 *Improve on Motion Magic
 *Work on some type of vision system


Notes for this year:
 *We will use pneumatics this year for climbing and for the control panel
 *Currently (1st week) we will be using two controllers (Gamecube and Generic Logitech)


Concepts that might be useful later in design:
 *We could use the ADXRS450 gyroscope mounted vertically to determine if we're level when climbing
